Issue tracking and discussions for [Dictionarry](https://dictionarry.dev/)

## How it works

This repository hosts discussions for quality profiles, custom formats, and regex patterns on the Dictionarry website using [Utterances](https://utteranc.es).

Each configuration page has its own issue thread where users can:
- Report problems
- Suggest improvements
- Ask questions
- Share experiences

Issues are automatically created when someone comments on a configuration page for the first time.
